# Darkswing

A game about climbing randomly generated cubes to get record high Y levels.

## Gameplay

### Dark(swing)

The dark part of the game is that you are encapsulated in the dark. You have a flashlight (equip with `2`) to see forward and a little light around you to see around you.
Personally I thought it was pretty advanced. Casual players can turn off darkness by pressing `f`.

### (Dark)swing

The swinging part of the game is the grappler. You equip the grappler with `1` and can shoot it with `E` or `Left Mouse Button`. Pressing it again will retract the rope, pulling you to the target object.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:

```sh

git clone "https://github.com/OrtheSnowJames/darkswing"

```

2. Build the game (rust toolchain required)

```sh

cargo build --release

```

3. Run it!

```sh

target/release/darkswing

```

## TODO
[] Add multiplayer support

[] Add sprites (maybe)
